# Bitcoin Peer Crawler
A simple C program for academic purposes to explore Bitcoin peer discovery.  
Features asynchronous sockets, a connection pool, and a peer queue.

## Purpose

This software is intended for learning and research on peer-to-peer networks. It demonstrates:

- Resolving hostnames to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- Maintaining peers in a binary tree indexed by a polynomial rolling hash.
- Connecting asynchronously to peers using non-blocking sockets.
- Managing a connection pool and peer queue.

## Build

make 
or make DEBUG=1 to generate with debug symbols and debug logs

## Usage

./main [host] [port] [n of peers to discover]

example:
./main seed.bitcoin.sipa.be 8333 2000
